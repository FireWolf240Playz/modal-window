# modal-window

This is a small project where I experimented with the hidden class in CSS and added different ways to close a modal window in websites. The modal window is a common UI element that is used to display content on top of the current page without requiring the user to navigate to a new page. The goal of this project was to learn how to create a modal window using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to implement different ways for the user to close it.

Features

✅A simple, responsive modal window with customizable content

✅Uses the hidden class in CSS to show and hide the window

✅Supports multiple ways to close the window, including clicking on the close button, pressing the escape key, or clicking outside the window

✅Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

How to Use

Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Click the "Open Modal" button to display the modal window.

Use any of the available methods to close the window.
